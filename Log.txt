       Currently working on the web app.

       Using bulma to create some templates.

       Have managed to build usort-lib with ghc-js.

       Things to do next:

       - Write the other templates
       - Write the controller
           - Connect the DOM API to usort-lib somehow

       I'll just write the templates first so it's done.

       I'd like to talk about what I need to do next.

       I have a couple templates now -- enough to know I can definitely use Bulma and make
       something that is usable. I still need to decide how to wire up the data to the
       view. And I need to decide how to change the view. I guess I need the internet for
       that. The question is do I want to write my own for fun, or do I just use something
       off the shelf? And if I go off the shelf, do I go javascript native or Haskell
       native? Is there a js-native option that I can hook up to a frp? Or are there
       js-native options that are close enough to frp to make it unnecessary? Once again I
       find myself needing to write a js web app...

       To compile to javascript:

       (Build ghc-js)
              emconfigure ./configure --target=javascript-unknown-ghcjs

       cd usort-web/ghc; nix-shell
       cabal build \
              -w $PWD/usort-web/ghc/_build/stage1/bin/javascript-unknown-ghcjs-ghc usort-lib \
              --with-hc-pkg $PWD/usort-web/ghc/_build/stage1/bin/javascript-unknown-ghcjs-ghc-pkg \
              --allow-newer

       Spent time trying to install pretty-simple, which petered out when Cabal tried to
       build Setup for javascript, but pretty-simple uses defaultMainWithDoctest, which
       uses runProcessInteractive, which doesn't exist.

       Now I understand that I need to write an executable that "exports" functions
       through the JS api. That's what I'll do next. Then I'll try to make a demo.

       I keep losing track of what I was working on, so let's look and document a bit.

       I can build usort-lib and usort-web, but I can't run it yet because there are
       problems with text when compiled with ghc2js. I assume other people are working on
       those problems? I actually don't know. Also I don't think I am set up with a clear
       way to run `cabal test` and have it test the pure code version of things. Can we
       add that under a feature flag and start using it? Also, has anything else changed
       to the text library yet?

       Indeed. The next thing to do is add a pure-haskell flag to the cabal description,
       add an issue to the upstream repo about pure-haskell implementation for javascript,
       find and link to any relevant discussion in that issue, and then start implementing
       things purely.
